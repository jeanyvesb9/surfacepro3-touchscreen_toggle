# surfacepro3-touchscreen_toggle
A Surface Pro 3 touch screen toggle, for using OneNote without palm recognition fails

This script is meant to toggle the touch screen and the capacitive windows button on the Microsoft Surface Pro 3, since palm rejection keeps failing, and I can't use OneNote reliably for taking notes.

REQUIRES:

- DevManView: used to toggle the device drivers on/off, and obtaining the registry value used as a flag to recognize if the device is already on or off.
- Avanced BAT to EXE Converter: used to convert the .bat script to an .exe that the Surface Configuration App can choose to execute when the eraser pen button is holded (I choosed this option, since I don't use Cortana that often, and it's handy to be able to toggle the touch on/off from the pen I'm already holding)

BEFORE USING THIS SCRIPT, YOU SHOULD UPDATE THE REGISTRY ADDRESSES AND THE DEVICE ID IN THE BAT COMMANDS. OTHERWISE IT WILL NOT WORK!!!!

TODO:
- Turn this into a proper App, that can be downloaded from the Store, and doesn't have to be fiddled with before first time use.
